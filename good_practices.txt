Francesco baldissera and Andreu Carreño's good practices:
As code is red much more than written these good practices are in order to ease the readability of our code

1. Use 4 spaces or a tab per identation level(unless it's a continuation line).
2.Importing all libraries on top of the code and in separates lines.
3. write descriptive and lower case function names.
4. maximum line lentgh of 79 characters.
5. we should break a line after a binary operator, not before.
6. Code in the core Python distributiion should always use UTF-8.
7.Paragraphs inside a block comment are separated by a line containing a single #.
8. prioratize using local variables over global ones.
9.Use panda data frames as much as possible. Sliced data frame should always be assigned 
to a variable.
